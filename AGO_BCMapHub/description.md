## Context

ESRI's extension of ArcGIS into the cloud, ArcGIS Online provides a space to develop applications and share apps and contents for purposes of collaboration. The official BC Government location for ESRI's ArcGIS Online (AGOL) tool. It is a cloud-based tool which allows a user to develop applications and share geospatial information. Useful to link GIS Analyst work with Business users to share maps and reports. Primary Strengths -	"Simple applications that can be built and shared with groups, a ministry, government or public". Hundreds of default templates to choose from including story books. ArcGIS Online collector for quick, simple field data collection.
Elastic server architecture for high, short term use applications


## Context and Problem Statement

Business Areas who may have internal GIS Staff who are able to build and support the web mapping solution and they may not have access to software developers.

## Decision Drivers

* skillset of team (may be historial GIS analysts familiar with ArcGIS Products vs IT Developers)

## Considered Options

* refer to root of this repo - 


### Positive Consequences 

*cloud based service offering that is scalable, and accessible to GIS analysts who may not be developeres


### Negative Consequences 

* costs
* not open source
* hosted outside of Canada

# Additional Information

## Hosting / Development Requirements
* Can Self-serve/wizard option to build web mapping applications quickly with no coding/scripting experience
* Can Self-serve/wizard option to build web mapping applications quickly with coding/scripting experience

## End User Requirements	
* Can Easily FIND the web mapping application and data within the map
* Can Easily FIND metadata/information about the data in the web mapping application 
* Can ACCESS the web mapping application via their mobile device
* Can SHARE the mapping application session and its data internally within government
* Can SHARE the mapping application session and its data externally with non-government 
* Can Consume and integrate local data into the web mapping application 
* Can Consume and integrate Provincial data into the web mapping application - can be WMS/WFS - limited, better with ArcGIS Rest services.
* Can Consume and integrate External data into the web mapping application (WMS, REST) 
* Can Transfer data collected within the web mapping application to operational systems 
* Can Collect data	Yes - through Collector for AGO and Survey123 for AGO mobile apps

* Can Access visualization tools in the web mapping application 
* Can Identify & discover relationships among features (e.g. proximity, intersection) 
* Can Detect statistically significant patterns (e.g. hotspots, outliers) 
* Can Use analytical models to make predictions based on data	(AGO does have some capabilities - but we encourage folks to use ArcMap or Pro instead.  Complexity of desired analytical model may be a factor and incur hosting costs)
* Types of training available - in person, webinars, documentation, ESRI Support
Mobile Friendly	- Yes
